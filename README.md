# Panoramas-and-Image-Alignment
Computer Vision Project, stitching different perspective images into a single smooth panorama using Laplacian Blending.

Homographic and Affine Transformation were used to create Perspective and Cylindrical warping respectively. The SIFT feature descriptors of the images are then matched together and blended to form a single panoramic view.
